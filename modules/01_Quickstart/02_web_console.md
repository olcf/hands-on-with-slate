# Web Console

The easiest way to access and interact with OpenShift is through the web console
and is avaiable to all users. Log in with either your Moderate or Open credentials.

## Exercise: Logging in with the web console

|Cluster|URL|
|---|---|
|Marble (Moderate Production cluster with access to Summit/Alpine)|[https://marble.ccs.ornl.gov](https://marble.ccs.ornl.gov)|
|Onyx (Open Production Cluster with access to Wolf)|[https://onyx.ccs.ornl.gov](https://onyx.ccs.ornl.gov)|

After logging in to the web console, you'll be on a Projects page.

## Exercise: Explore the Adminstrator and Developer Perspectives

In the navigation bar on the left, at the top you should see either **Developer** or **Administrator**
which you can toggle to switch between.

The **Administrator** perspective gives you an overview of the various Kubernetes and cluster objects such as:
**Operators**, **Workloads**, **Networking**, **Storage**, **Builds**

The **Develper** perspective has an overview **Topology** which tries to organize resources in a Project in a more
understandable way as well as the catalog for adding new deployments.
