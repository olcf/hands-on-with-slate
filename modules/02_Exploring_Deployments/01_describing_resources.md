# Exploring Resources

In the previous section we focused on the Developer section of the OpenShift web console
but we will be focusing on using the CLI tools in this section.

**What is a Deployment?**

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the
desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing
Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

[Upstream documentation on deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

## Exercise: Create a Basic Deployment

There are several ways to create a deployment on OpenShift using the CLI tool. The first approach will create a
deployment object for us. To create a deployment without YAML, use the following:

```bash
$ oc create deployment hello-world-cli --image "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0"
```

We can verify this deployment has been created by running:

```bash
$ oc get deployments
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello-world-cli        1/1     1            1           1m
```

Before starting with the next section, delete the deployment first using:

```bash
$ oc delete deployment hello-world-cli
```

### Create a Deployment using YAML

Another way is to create the YAML then apply it to the cluster. This is a preferred method when customizing the
Deployment is needed like adding labels or specifying readiness/liveness probes. We don't have to start YAML
from scratch though, native Kubectl provides the flags `--dry-run -o yaml` that we can use to generate template:

| Flag | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Do not actually create the resource on the server |
| `-o yaml` | Change the command output to YAML |

```bash
$ oc create deployment hello-world-cli --image "gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0" --dry-run=client -o yaml | tee > hello-world-cli-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: hello-world-cli
  name: hello-world-cli
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world-cli
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: hello-world-cli
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
        name: hello-app
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

Lets edit this file to look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world-cli
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world-cli
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world-cli
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
        name: hello-world-cli
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

Now we can apply the yaml to the cluster:

```bash
$ oc create -f hello-world-cli-deployment.yaml
```

## Exercise: Describing a Deployment

While it may look like a Deployment is a self-contained object, in reality it just manages ReplicaSets which
in turn manages one or more Pods.

Now that we have our deployment running in the cluster, we can get information on these different components
with `oc describe`:

```bash
$ oc describe deployment hello-world-cli
Name:                   hello-world-cli
...
Selector:               app=hello-world-cli
StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
Pod Template:
  Labels:  app=hello-world-cli
  Containers:
   hello-world-cli:
    Image:        gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    Port:         8080/TCP
    Host Port:    0/TCP
  ...
...
Events:
  Type    Reason             Age    From                   Message
  ----    ------             ----   ----                   -------
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  2m27s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set hello-world-cli-d5898598f to 1
```

We do not know the names of the ReplicaSets or Pods because they are autogenerated but we can use the
label selector `app=hello-world-cli` which corresponds to the label that we defined in our Deployment
YAML above.

```bash
$ oc describe replicasets -l app=hello-world-cli
Name:           hello-world-cli-d5898598f
...
Labels:         pod-template-hash=d5898598f
                app=hello-world-cli
Controlled By:  Deployment/hello-world-cli
Replicas:       1 current / 1 desired
Pods Status:    1 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
Pod Template:
  Labels:  pod-template-hash=d5898598f
           app=hello-world-cli
  Containers:
   hello-world-cli:
    Image:        gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    Port:         8080/TCP
    Host Port:    0/TCP
    ...
Events:
  Type    Reason            Age   From                   Message
  ----    ------            ----  ----                   -------
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  26m   replicaset-controller  Created pod: hello-world-cli-d5898598f-c78rm
```

Now we will describe the Pod using the same label selector.

```bash
$ oc describe pods -l app=hello-world-cli
Name:         hello-world-cli-d5898598f-c78rm
...
Labels:       pod-template-hash=d5898598f
              app=hello-world-cli
...
Status:       Running
...
Containers:
  hello-world-cli:
    Image:          gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    ...
    Limits:

      memory:  500Mi
    Requests:

      memory:     500Mi
...
Events:
