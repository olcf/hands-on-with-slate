# Debugging Introduction
When Kubernetes goes right it is amazing: things just work. But, unfortunately, that is not always the case. In this module we will go over some very common problems with running applications on Kubernetes and various ways you can investigate those problems.

These examples will be using the [oc CLI application](https://console-openshift-console.apps.marble.ccs.ornl.gov/command-line-tools) to apply our demos.
