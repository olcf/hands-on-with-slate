# Slate Tutorials

This repository contains hands-on tutorials for Slate users and is intended to be self-paced
modules focusing on different aspects of deploying applications onto Kubernetes.

The training modules are set up as a series of Markdown-based documentation files. Github has
an integrated Markdown renderer and can be used to easily view the module if you are unfamiliar
with Markdown. The README.md file in each module is the start point for the module and you can
follow the links at the bottom of each file to go to the next exercise.

You are welcome and encouraged to check out this repository to your local machine. Some modules
may refer to configuration files and other data which should be contained in the module directory
next to the Markdown.
